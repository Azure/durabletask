# Durable Task Framework History Events

The following are some common history events that make up an orchestration's state. You can easily view these events in the History table for the [Azure Storage](https://github.com/Azure/durabletask/tree/main/src/DurableTask.AzureStorage) and [MSSQL](https://github.com/microsoft/durabletask-mssql) storage backends for DTFx. Understanding these events can be useful when working with the DTFx code, debugging issues, or creating diagnostic tools that read the history directly (like the [Durable Functions Monitor project](https://github.com/scale-tone/DurableFunctionsMonitor)).

| Event Type | Description |
|-|-|
| `OrchestratorStarted` | The orchestrator function is starting a new _execution_. You will see many of these events in your history - one for each time that an orchestrator resumes from an `await`. Note that this does _NOT_ mean that the orchestrator is starting for the first time - first time execution is represented by the `ExecutionStarted` history event (see below). The timestamp of this event is used to populate the `CurrentDateTimeUtc` property. |
| `ExecutionStarted` | The orchestration has started executing for the first time. This event contains the name of the orchestrator, its input, and the time at which the orchestration was _scheduled_ (which might be earlier than the `OrchestratorStarted` event that precedes it in the history). This is always the second event in an orchestration history. |
| `TaskScheduled` | The orchestrator has scheduled an activity task. This event includes the name of the activity, its input, and a sequential `EventId` that can be used to correlate the `TaskScheduled` event to its corresponding `TaskCompleted` or `TaskFailed` event. Note that there may be multiple `Task***` events generated if an activity task is retried. |
| `TaskCompleted` | A scheduled task activity has completed successfully. The `TaskScheduledId` field will match the `EventId` field of the corresponding `TaskScheduled` event. |
| `TaskFailed` | A scheduled task activity has completed with a failure. The `TaskScheduledId` field will match the `EventId` field of the corresponding `TaskScheduled` event. |
| `SubOrchestrationInstanceCreated` | The orchestrator has scheduled a sub-orchestrator. This event contains the name, instance ID, input, and ordered event ID of the scheduled orchestrator, which can be used to correlate the `SubOrchestrationInstanceCreated` event with a subsequent `SubOrchestrationInstanceCompleted` or `SubOrchestrationInstanceFailed` history event. The timestamp refers to the time at which the sub-orchestrator was _scheduled_, which will be earlier than the time in which it starts executing. Note that there may be multiple `SubOrchestrationInstance***` events generated if an activity task is retried. |
| `SubOrchestrationInstanceCompleted` | A scheduled sub-orchestrator has completed successfully. The `TaskScheduledId` field will match the `EventId` field of the corresponding `SubOrchestrationInstanceCreated` event. |
| `SubOrchestrationInstanceFailed` | A scheduled sub-orchestrator has completed with a failure. The `TaskScheduledId` field will match the `EventId` field of the corresponding `SubOrchestrationInstanceCreated` event. |
| `TimerCreated` | The orchestrator scheduled a durable timer. The `FireAt` property contains the date at which the timer will fire. |
| `TimerFired` | A previously scheduled durable timer has fired. The `TimerId` field will match the `EventId` field of the corresponding `TimeCreated` event. |
| `EventRaised` | An orchestration (or entity in the case of [Durable Entities](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-entities)) has received an external event. This record contains the name of the event, the payload, and the timestamp for when the event was _sent_ (which should be around the same time or earlier than when this history event was actually persisted). |
| `EventSent` | An orchestration (or entity) has sent a one-way message to another orchestration (or entity). |
| `ExecutionCompleted` | The orchestration has completed. This event includes the output of the orchestration and doesn't distinguish between success or failure. |
| `ExecutionTerminated` | The orchestration was forcefully terminated by an API call. The timestamp of this event represents the time at which termination was _scheduled_ and not necessarily the time at which it actually terminated. |
| `OrchestratorCompleted` | The orchestrator function has awaited and committed any side effects. You will see many of these events in your history - one for each time that an orchestrator awaits. Note that this does _NOT_ mean that the orchestrator has completed (completion is represented by either `ExecutionCompleted` or `ExecutionTerminated`). |
| `GenericEvent` | A generic history event with a `Data` field, but has no specific meaning. This history event is not commonly used. In some cases, this event is used to trigger a fresh replay of an idle orchestration, such as after an orchestration is rewound. |
| `HistoryStateEvent` |  A history event that contains a snapshot of the orchestration history. This event type is not used in most modern backend types. |
